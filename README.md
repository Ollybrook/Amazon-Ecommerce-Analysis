# Amazon E-commerce Analytics: Product & Customer Review Insights
This project involves a comprehensive data analysis of Amazon product pages and customer review data. As a Junior Data Analyst at RetailTech Insights, this analysis aims to generate actionable insights to guide product improvement, inform marketing strategies, and enhance customer engagement for e-commerce sellers on platforms like Amazon.
**Business Problem:** E-commerce sellers need deeper insights into product performance, customer sentiment, and market trends to optimize their offerings and competitive standing. This analysis seeks to transform raw Amazon data into strategic intelligence.
**Dataset:** `amazon_product_data.xlsx`
* **Source:** Information scraped from Amazon product pages.
* **Records:** 1,465 unique product entries.
* **Fields:** 16 columns including product name, category, price, discount, ratings, user reviews, and reviewer data (aggregated as comma-separated values).
* **Nature:** Each row represents a unique product.
* **Analysis Tasks & Questions Addressed:**
Using pivot tables and calculated columns in Excel, the following analyses were performed:
1.  Average discount percentage by product category.
2.  Number of products listed under each category.
3.  Total number of reviews per category.
4.  Products with the highest average ratings.
5.  Average actual price vs. discounted price by category.
6.  Products with the highest number of reviews.
7.  Number of products with a discount of 50% or more.
8.  Distribution of product ratings (e.g., how many products are rated 3.0, 4.0, etc.).
9.  Total potential revenue (actual_price × rating_count) by category.
10. Number of unique products per price range bucket (<₹200, ₹200–₹500, >₹500).
11. Relationship between rating and level of discount.
12. Number of products with fewer than 1,000 reviews.
13. Categories with products having the highest discounts.
14. Identification of the top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined.
15. **Tools & Technologies:**
* Microsoft Excel (for data cleaning, pivot tables, calculated columns, and dashboard creation)
Key Insights/Findings
"Wearable Technology had the highest average discount percentage, indicating competitive pricing in this category."
"Home Appliances & Kitchen categories dominated in terms of product listings and total reviews, signifying high market activity."
"The highest potential revenue categories were driven by a combination of high price points and substantial review counts, pointing to strong market demand."
**Interactive Dashboard:**
An interactive Excel dashboard has been created to visualize the key insights derived from the analysis. The dashboard provides a dynamic way to explore product performance across categories, understand customer sentiment, and identify strategic opportunities. It includes charts and slicers to allow for easy filtering and deeper dives into the data.
